# Gaming Portfolio

This is an interactive gaming portfolio showcasing a collection of classic and modern games built with React, TypeScript, and other modern web technologies.

## About the Project

This project serves as a personal portfolio to demonstrate my skills in web development, particularly in building interactive and engaging user experiences. Each game is developed as a self-contained module with its own components, hooks, and type definitions, showcasing a clean and scalable code architecture.

## Development Guidelines

*   **Centralized Constants:** All global constants should be defined in `src/util_const.ts` to ensure a single source of truth and improve maintainability.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Games

This portfolio features the following games:

*   **Tic Tac Toe:** A classic strategy game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
*   **2048:** A single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
*   **Flappy Bird:** A popular side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.
*   **Snake (Coming Soon):** The player controls a snake which grows in length, with the snake itself being the primary obstacle.
*   **Memory Game (Coming Soon):** A card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
